# Agenda of Week 4 Live Session

1. Quiz 3

2. An Application of Multinomial Logistic Regressoin: Modeling Voters' Party - Evidence from the 2016 American National Election Survey


\newpage
In this exercise, we want to model voters’ self identified party affiliation using their demographic characteristic and a handful of self-indentifying variables.The data was obtained from the **American National Election Survey**, which conducted a survey several months prior to the $2016$ American Presidential elections. *Note that the original survey data uses survey weights, which we will not use here.*

The dataset “*voters.csv*” contains a handful of variables from the survey, and these variables have been cleaned and modified for this exercise. This dataset contains the following variables:

**Variable Name**            |          **Explanations**
-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------
party                        | Categorical variable indicating respondents’       party affiliation: Democrat, Independent, Republican
-----------------------------| ----------------------------------------------
Presjob                      | A seven point scale indicating respondents’ evaluation of President Obama. 1 = Very strongly approve; 7 = Very strongly disapprove
-----------------------------| ----------------------------------------------
Srv_spend                    | Seven point scale representing the degree to       which respondents believe that the government should provide or should not provide services:  1 = Government should provide many fewer services; 7 = Government should provide many more services.
-----------------------------| ----------------------------------------------
age                          | Respondents’ age, as of 2016.
-----------------------------| ----------------------------------------------
race_white                   | Dummy variable taking a value of one if the        respondent is white and is zero otherwise.
-----------------------------| ----------------------------------------------
female                       | Dummy variable taking a value of one if the        respondent is female and is zero otherwise.

# Convert all the character variables to factor variables
voters <- voters %>%
  mutate_if(sapply(voters, is.character), as.factor)
```

**Breakout-room Discussion:**
  - Discuss the structure of the data
  - Discuss missing values and how you would typically handle them at work
  - Discuss the patterns of these variables 
  - Add additional tables and plots to enhance your EDA where needed
  
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

str(voters)
skim(voters)
describe(voters)

#voters[!complete.cases(voters),]
sapply(voters, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))


# Keep only the complete cases in the dataset
voters2 <- voters[complete.cases(voters),]

# Reorder the categories of srv_spend
voters2$srv_spend <- ordered(voters2$srv_spend, levels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"))

# Attach the dataste
attach(voters2)
```

**Pause and Discuss: Missing values**
For now, we would simply exclude them in our analysis. *In practice, you do not just want to throw away observations without any investigation.*

# EDA:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Descriptive statistics
str(voters2)
skim(voters2)
describe(voters2)

#Univariate Analysis
apply(voters2, 2, table)
exam_cat_var = function(var.names) {
  round(prop.table(table(var.names)),2)
}
apply(voters2, 2, exam_cat_var)

# Bivariate Analysis
cross_tab = function(xvar, yvar) {
  CrossTable(xvar, yvar, digits = 2,
           prop.c = FALSE, prop.t = FALSE, chisq = TRUE)
}
# President Approval by Party
cross_tab(voters2$presjob, voters2$party)
# Spending Sentiment by Party
cross_tab(voters2$srv_spend, voters2$party)
# Gender by Party
cross_tab(voters2$female, voters2$party)
# Race by Party
cross_tab(voters2$race_white, voters2$party)

# Age Distribution by Party
ggplot(voters2, aes(factor(party), age)) +  
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(party))) + 
  ggtitle("Age by Party Affiliation") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=1, face="bold")) 

# Age Distribution by President Approval

cross_tab(voters2$female, voters2$presjob)
cross_tab(voters2$race_white, voters2$presjob)

# Spending Sentiment by Party and Race

# Multinomial Logistic Regression Model

** Breakout-room Discussion: **
  - Estimate a multinomial logistic regression with only `age`, `female`, and `race_white` as explanatory variables. Call the regression `mod.nomial1`
  - Discussion the estimation results. For instance, is being a male more or less likely to be a Democrat (relative to being a Republican)? Answer questions like this using your regression results.


```{r}
# mod.nominal1 <- multinom(FORMULA, data = voters2)
# summary(YOUR ESTIMATED MODEL)
```

# Statistical Inference

** Breakout-room Discussion: **
  - As starter, test the existance of the age effect in the logit of independent vs democrat equation. (Hint: For simplicity, use Wald test.)
  - Test the existence of effect of an explanatory variable on all response categories.


```{r}
# YOUR CODE TO BE HERE
```


# Model Interpretation
** Breakout-room Discussion: **
  - Interpret the estimated coefficients of the model in terms of estimated odds
  
To interpret the coefficients, we first exponentiate the estimated coefficients

```{r}
# YOUR CODE TO BE HERE
```


# Calculation of Estimated Probabilities

** Breakout-room Discussion **
  - Estimated probabilities for each of the observations in the sample (it's also called "Fitted Value")
  - Discuss the estimated probabilities

In practice, however, one could obtaine these estimated probability by simply call the *predict()* function with the correct parameter and a dataset from which the estimated probabilities will be calculated.
